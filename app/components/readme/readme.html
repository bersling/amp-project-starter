<h1 id="ampprojectstarter">AMP Project Starter</h1>
<p>
  Starting a new project can take a lot of time, especially if the technology is new to you. What often helps is a <b>project starter</b>, meaning a template so you can have a look at how it's done.
</p>
<p>For the development process, the AMP project itself has very good <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components">documentation</a> and additionally there's
  <a href="https://ampbyexample.com/">AMP by Example</a> which helps with countless examples. Both of those resources are great, but they lack information on how to <i>actually</i> build an entire AMP page. This is where this starter comes in!

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/bersling/amp-project-starter
cd amp-project-starter
npm install
npm start</code></pre>
<h2 id="projectstructure">Project structure</h2>
<p>To get an overview of what you'll be working with, here's the structure:</p>
<pre><code>tsmean-amp/

│   ├── components/ # here are reusable UI elements for your app
│   │   ├── some-component/
│   │   │   ├── some-component.html

</code></pre>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<h3 id="runningaserver">Running a server</h3>
<p>You can run a local server for development using</p>
<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>
<p>Now you should have a server running at port 8082. You'll just do this at the start of each development session. If you're heading ofer to http://localhost:8082, you'll find what the server is serving. If you've built the project, it should display the landing page.</p>
<h3 id="rebuildingwhenyouchangedsomething">Rebuilding when you changed something</h3>
<p>To rebuild the project, after you've modified html or scss files or after you've added images to the img directory (or after any changes at all), run:</p>
<pre><code>npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>This executes the "build" command in "scripts" in the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="changingthehtml">Changing the html</h3>
<p>Html is divided into two groups: pages and components. Pages are e.g. /about or /home. Components are things you want to <strong>reuse</strong>, for example <code>footer.html</code> which you'll use on every page. After changes, run <code>npm run build</code>.</p>
<h3 id="changingthestylescssscss">Changing the styles (css / scss)</h3>
<p>Scss is sass, which is a precompiler for css to write more modular css. It's actually pretty easy to learn, you'll get the basics in 10 minutes by reading: http://sass-lang.com/guide</p>
<p>If styles are for a specific component, put them in the same folder as the html. <strong>You'll have to register/import all .scss files in styles.scss!</strong></p>
<p>If they are general-purpose styles, put them in the styles folder at a matching position.</p>
<p>After changes, run <code>npm run build</code>.</p>
<h3>AMP</h3>
<p>Since it's an AMP project, you'll have to be careful to follow the rules
  of AMP. For instance, in an AMP project you're not allowed to use
  the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. You'll have to use the <code>&lt;amp-img&gt;</code> tag. If you don't follow those rules
  your page doesn't break, it just doesn't get the "AMP-SEO Bonus" anymore. During the build process, it logs to the console whether each page passes amp validation or not.</p>
<p>AMP has a lot of predefined components and a pretty good documentation you can find at https://www.ampproject.org/ and you'll find examples for all components at https://ampbyexample.com/.</p>
